         <h3> Review</h3> <p> <strong> By Mason R✓:</strong> This movie has everything for the fans of this beloved worldwide phenomenon of a video game franchise. When we watched this movie opening night, the crowd was insane from beginning to the very very end credits scene. I think this is the best video game movie of 2023. Josh hutcherson was great, Matthew lillard nailed it, and the practical effects from Jim hensons creature shop was possibly the best thing about the movie. Freddy, Bonnie, chica, foxy, and that no good cupcake stole the entire show. I wasn’t bored at all, I was invested the whole time. I hope we get more of these movies. Video game adaptations are no longer in the cursed department. </p>

         <h3>Review</h3>
         <p> <strong>By Brandon Richardson✓:</strong> Tired, lazy, and stale. Morbius had potential but Sony's direction was not what it needed. I'm not a stickler for CGI but it was blatantly obvious that this could have had more work done on it. They had a great cast but the talent is wasted on an inconsistent plot and nonsensical cameos and references.</p>

      <td> <h3> Synopsis</h3> <p>Growing up in the early 1800s, P.T. Barnum displays a natural talent for publicity and promotion, selling lottery tickets by age 12. After trying his hands at various jobs, P.T. turns to show business to indulge his limitless imagination, rising from nothing to create the Barnum & Bailey circus. Featuring catchy musical numbers, exotic performers and daring acrobatic feats, Barnum's mesmerizing spectacle soon takes the world by storm to become the greatest show on Earth.</p>

         <h3>Review</h3>
         <p> <strong>By Brianna Mellissa T.:</strong> The Greatest Showman movie is exceptional, the songs have a lot of contrast with the situations that arise and help you to better understand the way people feel. Likewise, the actors do a great job, as they express themselves, making the viewer identify and empathize with them. Also the art that is reflected in the costumes and scenery is very nice, it makes you want to be there. The story is very good, it shows the life of someone who always sought to be better and more important, and also the consequences that this entailed, showing that it is not easy and that family should not be left aside and that it can also be found in other environments such as work. I recommend it because it is a film that you enjoy a lot, both visually and aurally. It is for all ages and the story is very good.</p>
